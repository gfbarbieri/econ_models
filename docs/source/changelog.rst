Change Log
==========

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Create the econ_models library with limited functional properties and one economic actor. Documentation has
been templated, but incomplete. Functions and classes for other properties and economic actors have been
templated, but mostly undeveloped. I am hoping this base release will encourage development, assuming the
goal is understood and useful.
