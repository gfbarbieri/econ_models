The econ_models project is an open source, Python project. Everyone who interacts with each other on platforms
dealing with this project are expected to be open, considerate, and respectful. Given the time required to
maintain any open source project and the type of space the project wants to encourage, all contributions
will be shown gratitude and recognition.
